            <h1> Welcome to My Webpage </h1>
            <p>
              I grew up in a small town named Verona, New Jersey. My lifetime has consisted of refining new skills
              due to my unwavering curiosity of how far my potential can reach. At a young age, I was
              building legos, reading dystopic thrillers, perfecting different athletics, and becoming
              a history buff most likely stemming from my Father's teachings. With the philosophical
              and introspective nature of my childhood, I was bred to see the world through the lens of
              science and economics. Ultimately, I was accepted to Lehigh University and fulfilled a double major
              in Economics and Behavioral Neuroscience. My education paved the path for me to focus on my love
              for technology and the unlimited potential I believe is obtainable for life on Earth.
              Combining curiosity and rationale,
              I find it necessary to use technology to improve humanities foresight.
            Foresight, as much of sixth sense it may seem, can be honed to change the course of the future, and I
            believe advances in data science will sharpen mankind's decision making for a better tomorrow. My focus
            now is to get on board the ship of technology by improving my computer skills and maintaining a better work
            ethic each successive day.
