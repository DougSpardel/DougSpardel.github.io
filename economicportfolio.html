          <h1> Economic Portfolio </h1>
          <h2> Background </h2>
          <p>
            Economics encompasses a plethora of topics and I found it important
          to specialize and find the areas suited for me. I initially
          was convinced that I would make an excellent lawyer and policy maker,
          but was quickly enamored with pricing, optimaization, and overall
          marginal analysis due to the mathematical applications. This track led
          me to hunt for the root of optimization which is ultiamtely the study
          of Game Theory, where I was able to focus on COVID-19 related topics such as the introduction of ventilators
          and the idea of grey-area cases being used as political fuel. Ultimately, I became frustrated with the theoretical nature
          of game theory, thus, evolving my interests to return to statistics and enhance my understanding of the world through
          causal regressions. Combining game theory and data analysis, I came to the understanding that my true interests did
          not strictly lie in explaining the present, but in predicting the future. In my
          recent applied microeconometrics class, I was able to master STATA and
          move on to my ultimate goal of learning Machine Learning with Python. My recent studies have involved analyzing the future
          of immigration flow over the Mexican border using past trends.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keeping an open mind and learning out of interest rather than
          making a schedule easier or taking shortcuts has always been my philosophy.
          This mindset has allowed me to apply applications to the real world whether it
          be choosing the most ethical policy, optimal price, or beneficial decision for the individual.
