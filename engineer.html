          <h2> Background </h2>
          <p>
          At the start of Summer 2020, I began a new journey into the world of
          manufacturing and process engineering. I drove from New Jersey to Portland,
          Oregon across Interstate 80, completing my first of many cross country
          journeys. From the jump, I was introduced into a blown up version of
          and organic chemistry lab which focused on the production of hand sanitizer and the
          extraction and distillation of multiple cannabinoids from hemp.
          Furthermore, there was a vessel production station positioned next to the
          factory which focused on making tanks to be used for these chemical processes.
          The vertical integration from setup, to process, to marketing was an invaluable
          experience that showed the many complications involved in manufacturing as well as the favorable profit
          margins a well executed plan can produce. Working 12 hour shifts, I was able to further my organic chemistry
          education, execute efficient process engineering, dabble in 3d design, and learn a valuable lesson to stay alert
          at all times.
          Recapping the months at the end of the summer allowed me to statistically see the personal effects
          I had on the production as our team was able to increase yields by nearly 100% at certain periods depending
          on the demand.
